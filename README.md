Implementation of elliptic curve scalar multiplication algorithm using the MNAMNAA atomic patterns from Patrick Longa's work "Accelerating the scalar multiplication on elliptic curve cryptosystems over prime fields"(2008).
- Developed for Side-Channel Analysis of an atomic pattern kP algorithm implementation in an embedded device
- Written in C
- Using the constant-runtime functions from the open source cryptographic library FLECC in C
- Tested on a Texas Instruments LAUNCHXL-F28379D LaunchPad
